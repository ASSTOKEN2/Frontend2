							<p className="mx-5 mb-4">Exploring fractional ownership in tokenized real estate investments involves dividing the ownership of a property into smaller, more accessible shares represented by tokens on a blockchain. This concept allows multiple investors to collectively own and trade fractions of real estate assets, reducing barriers to entry and increasing liquidity in the market.</p>
							<p className="mx-5">Tokenization involves converting the ownership rights of a property into digital tokens, typically using blockchain technology. Fractional ownership through tokenization offers several benefits. Firstly, it enables broader participation in the real estate market, as investors can own fractional shares of high-value properties that would otherwise be financially inaccessible. Additionally, tokenization enhances liquidity by facilitating easier and faster trading of these fractional shares.</p>
